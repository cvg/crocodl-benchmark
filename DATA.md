## Data
This readme file will hel you understand our data in more detail. We will separate this section in three parts. First one is raw data and how to process it, second one being capture format we are using and general overview of the dataset we are providing. First two are the same as <a href="https://localizoo.com/crocodl/">Lamar</a>, therefore we provide explanation of raw data nad capture format from that codebase.

### 1 Raw Data
If you want to read more about raw-data you can have a look [here](RAW-DATA.md).

### 2 Capture Data
If you want to read more about capture-data you can have a look [here](CAPTURE.md).

### 3 Dataset Overview

Our data is split into 7 locations. These are *HYDRO*, *SUCCULENT*, *ARCHE_GRANDE*, *DESIGN*, *ARCHE_D2*, *ARCHE_B3* and *ARCHE_B5*. Downloading the data using our instructions from Huggingface, you will have following data structure:

```
capture/
├── {location}/                 # Folder with data for each location
│    └── ...
├── {location}_spot.txt         # File that stores list of sequences for spot that are used in this location
├── {location}_hololens.txt     # File that stores list of sequences for hololens that are used in this location
└── {location}_phone.txt        # File that stores list of sequences for phone that are used in this location
```

where location can be any of these 7 listed ones. Each of the locations has same structure inside, in the previous overview denoted with '...'. Each of these 7 locations has the following structure:

```
{location}/                                 # Capture directory for a location
